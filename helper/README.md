This folder contains two python files for synthtic data generation. As we do not have access to real streaming credit card fraud data, we conceptualize the synthetic data as real world data.
Synthetic data generation uses faker library. These files are not written by me, they are written by Jim Dowling and team from hopsworks, I'd like to acknowledge them here.
